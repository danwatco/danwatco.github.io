I've made a new blog! Yay!

Well, not really. ;) I've decided to make this blog to have an experiment with github pages and the use of jeykll within them! I'm an aspiring developer and am hoping to learn some new skills! I won't post that often on here, but if I find any tips & tricks along my journey, I will share them with you here! 

I hope you enjoy!

Thanks,

Dan Watkinson
