Hey I'm Dan, welcome to my first post.

I'm currrently studying an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Electronics at the University of Bristol. I have nearly finshed my first year and am looking for a way I can share the knowledge I have gained over my first year at uni. It has been an very interesting year, I've learnt many new things and I have improved my knowledge of many other topics. Hopefully I can try and share with you what I have learnt and give you an insight into what a degree in Computer Science and Electronics is like.
